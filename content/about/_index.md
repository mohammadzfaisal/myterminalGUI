I'm a Cloud Engineer passionate about building scalable infrastructure, automating deployments, and leveraging AI to solve real-world problems.

With expertise in AWS, Kubernetes, and Infrastructure as Code, I help organizations modernize their cloud architecture and implement DevOps best practices.

When I'm not building cloud solutions, I enjoy sharing knowledge through blogging and contributing to the tech community.
